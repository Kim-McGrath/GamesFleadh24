1.Main menu is not fully working
2.There are no levels yet in the game, there are a few working objects on the only level that i've done so far there is a 
knight which has animation (not fully working) cow from the pack i downloaded from a free guide and a portal which triggers after you kill the slime.
3.The fighting mechanic is not fully finished and is working incorrectly

As i said, this is mostly a uni project for me and I don't need the game to be very big and long. Because the deadline is 
quite soon all i'm hoping for is to get a clean working version of the game. I do have a few ideas which I believe not going 
to take that much time to implement in the game. I also divided them into a few groups.

Whenever the game starts the player sees main menu with "levels" option and "endless" option.

Levels get user to one of two playable levels.
First level should be knight slaying a few waves of slimes, second - a boss fight.

After the first level is done user should receive a new dash ability from a chest.

Opened portal which is going to display some text when player interacts with it and brings player to the second level.

Second level where the bossfight happens, maybe if possible after boss is defeated to show some inventory tab.

Endless level which is just going to spawn enemies.



I think as for now that should be good enough for the game to be presented. 
One more thing which is important that I want a lot of comments in the code where u are going to put changes. 
It is really important for me to continue working on this project even after I do this demo on Monday. 
I would like to learn from how you write code and continue working upon it. I'm not that experienced with Godot 
from what u see so yeah, that'd be great for me.
