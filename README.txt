This is the game for our final project work for this semester OOP Module. 

It allowed us to develop extensive knowledge about Object Oriented programming, using GODOT game engine. 3 of us were developing it for a month, and while it's clearly not finished (we plan to work on it in the future) it is a great base project for a basic dungeon crawler game. 

Some of the sprites included in the game files are from free internet downloades, while knight, sword, background, menu and all playable interface was fully hand-drawn by our team.
